# Dasypygal Gentlemen data access API

This is a project that I created to learn Node.js and how to access Couchdb with more clarity and speed. As Node.js is JS and is great at concurancy with HTTP requests and CouchDB is all about JS and HTTP. (yes yes a run on :P) This would be a great place to combine it all.
